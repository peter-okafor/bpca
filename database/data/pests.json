   "Introduction": "The commonest species that invades houses is the Black Garden Ant, which is actually very dark brown. All ants have the main divisions of the body (head, thorax, abdomen) distinctly separated by very narrow waists and have a sharp elbow joint in their antennae. They are highly organised social insects. It is the foraging worker ants that invade buildings in search of food. These are from 3 to 5mm in length and are attracted to sweet foodstuffs which they take back to the nest to feed to the larvae and queen.",
   "PestType": "Crawling insect",
   "Description": "<p>The so-called ant's eggs sold for aquaria fish are actually the pupae. Flying ants are the reproductive males and females. These mating ants are winged and have a nuptial swarming flight during only a few days in July or August. Mating takes place in the air and the female then seeks out a nest site where she stays for the winter, laying eggs the following spring in order to start up a new colony.</p> <p><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"Ants-1\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/A-Z/Ants/Ants-1.jpg\" alt=\"Ants-1\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></p> <h2>How to deal with Ants</h2> <p>First, find the nest entrances. These are indicated by small piles of earth pellets or can be located by watching the ants moving back and forth from nest to food.</p> <p>Pouring a kettle of boiling water over the nest site is a first-aid measure.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some products cause the workers to destroy their own nests, for example, sugar based liquid bait. The workers are attracted to the bait and carry the insecticide back to the larvae and queen. Some centrally heated blocks of flats may be troubled by the much smaller tropical <a href=\"/pest-advice/a-z-of-pests/134390\">Pharaoh&rsquo;s Ant</a>, which prefers protein to sweet foods and has multiple - and often inaccessible &ndash; nests within the building structure.</p> <p><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"ants-3\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/A-Z/Ants/ants-3.jpg\" alt=\"ants-3\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></p> <p>Ghost Ants are becoming more common in heated buildings.

   "Name": "Bed bugs",
   "Introduction": "This common pest once associated with unhygienic surroundings is prevalent due to a number of reasons, including increased travel, the use of second-hand furniture, and suspected tolerance to some pesticides. These bugs still occur with regularity, particularly in multi-occupancy buildings with rapid resident turnover, for example, hostels, hotels, holiday camps and blocks of flats.",

It is wingless but the legs are well developed and it can crawl up most vertical surfaces. Their elongated eggs are cemented in cracks or crevices close to the hosts (which for Bed bugs are humans). The early stages of the Bed bug (nymphs) are tiny making them hard to detect with the naked eye.</p> <h2>Characteristics</h2> <p>Bed bugs can usually be introduced to your property as they attach to luggage, bags, and clothing. Bed bugs may also be introduced through second-hand beds, furniture, and possessions.</p> <p>Bed bugs can also travel from one room to another in search of food, or, after mating. Sometimes this may be a neighbouring property which then can create new infestations throughout multi-occupied premises.</p> <h2>Habitat</h2> <p>Mainly active at night Bed bugs hide in crevices in the bed, surrounding furniture, and also behind skirting boards, under loose wallpaper, behind pictures and even in plug sockets to name a few.</p> <p><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"bed bugs-2\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/A-Z/Bed Bugs/bed_bugs-2.jpg\" alt=\"bed bugs-2\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></p> <h2>Diet</h2> <p>Bed bugs need to feed on the blood of a human host. However, in some cases, they can survive up to a year without feeding.</p> <h2>Why control Bed bugs?</h2> <p>Bed bug bites cause red, irritating marks/ lumps. Not everyone reacts to the bites, however, some people develop a more severe skin reaction and can experience disturbed sleep.</p> <p>Bed bugs are not known to spread diseases. However, they can cause irritation and distress. Bed bugs can also ruin an organisation's reputation. If clients and customers experience a Bed bug infestation in the premises you manage, they are likely to complain and request a refund, report on your company negatively and be unlikely to want to do business with you again.</p> <p><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"bed bug-3\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/A-Z/Bed Bugs/bed_bug-3.jpg\" alt=\"bed bug-3\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></p> <h2>How to prevent Bed bugs</h2> <p>It's impossible to prevent a Bed bug infestation as they are generally spread through bad luck. However there are some things you can do to reduce your chances of getting an infestation: Before staying or moving into accommodation, make sure you check for signs of Bed bugs.</p> <p>Avoid taking any second-hand bedroom furniture without checking it thoroughly. If you have stayed in an infested room, upon arriving home, immediately check your luggage and clothing for bugs. If you find Bed bugs, to remove the bugs and eggs your luggage, clothing and bedding there are a few things you can do. Either; wash everything at a &lsquo;hot' (60&deg;C) temperature setting; tumbled dry at a &lsquo;hot setting for at least 30 minutes; dry clean everything; or place everything into a bag and then in the deep freezer for at least 3 days.</p> <p>For some businesses such as hotels, a proactive monitoring regime by a professional pest control organisation can help detect early signs. Also, training your staff in what to look for when they are cleaning and working within the rooms will mean you can detect a problem before a guest does, thereby protecting your reputations.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Signs of an infestation</h2> <ul> <li>Red irritating bites, typically in rows on your neck, shoulders, back, legs or arms.</li> <li>Clusters or dark spots (about 1mm wide) that look like an ink dot are usually found on the bed frame or on the bottom side of the mattress.</li> <li>Small blood smears<span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"> on the bed linen or </span>headboard<span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">.</span></li> <li>Finding the small brown insects in and around your bed frame and sleeping area.</li> </ul> <p><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"bed bug-4\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/A-Z/Bed Bugs/bed_bug-4.jpg\" alt=\"bed bug-4\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></p> <h2>How to get rid of Bed bugs</h2> <p>For a suspected Bed bug infestation, we strongly recommend you act immediately by contacting a professional pest control company, preferably a member of the BPCA.</p> <p>Self-treatment of a Bed bug infestation is unlikely to be successful.

They are rounder, larger and furrier and come with a variety of coloured stripes across the end of their tails. Nesting sites are normally found underground in abandoned burrows, bird boxes, under the decking, or in the compost bin.</p> <p>Bumblebees are social insects: they live in a colony with a queen and her offspring (the workers). Bumblebees have an annual lifecycle, with new nests being started each spring by queens. The queen bumblebees are very large, and from February onwards can be seen feeding on flowers such as willow catkins, bluebells and lungwort, or flying low over the ground searching for a nest site.</p> <p>Some species prefer to nest underground in abandoned burrows of rodents, while others nest just above the ground in dense grass or leaf-litter. The queen stocks her nest with pollen and nectar and lays her first batch of eggs. She incubates them much as a bird would, sitting on the eggs while shivering her flight muscles to produce warmth.</p> <p>When the eggs hatch the legless grubs consume pollen and nectar, grow rapidly, and pupate after a few weeks. A few days later the first workers hatch from their pupae and begin helping their queen, expanding the nest and gathering food. By mid-summer nests of some species can contain several hundred workers. At this point, the queen starts laying both male and female eggs.</p> <p>The females are fed extra food and become future queens. Both males and new queens leave the nest to mate, and the new queens burrow into the ground to wait until the following spring. The males, workers, and the old queen die off in the autumn, leaving the nest to decay.</p> <h3>Tree bees</h3> <p>A recent addition to the UK's fauna. Their banding is unique amongst the UK species. The thorax is tawny to reddish brown, the abdomen is black and tail is white. Fresh drones have a patch of yellowish facial fur, but this wears off with time. Queens vary significantly in size, and workers are normally quite small.</p> <p>Some traits of tree bees can be a cause of concern, but there is nothing to worry about. Commonly they establish a nest in bird boxes, or in parts of buildings, and may cause concern through apparent high level of nest flight activity due to &lsquo;nest surveillance' by drones, and the sound of bee chatter/activity heard through the ceiling are all signs of activity.</p> <h3>Solitary/Masonry bees</h3> <p>As the name suggests, they are solitary insects, and you'll rarely find them occurring in large numbers. They have a reddish-brown bottom and black body. You'll see these small bees popping in and out of the wall or very small holes in the ground.</p> <p>They nest in a wide range of cavities and have the ability to build nests by tunnelling through soft brick mortar, or exploiting pre-existing gaps left unrepaired. They do not cause a problem to your property from a structural point of view.</p> <h3>Honeybees</h3> <p>Providers of honey and almost universally viewed with affection in the UK. They rarely present problems as pests, however, feral swarms can set up home in undesirable places such as chimneys and wall cavities. Honey bees are small and vary in colour from golden brown to almost black.</p> <p>The most common scenario in which you may become concerned is when they swarm. Typically these intimidating swarms will first set up a temporary camp somewhere nearby, such as a tree branch, fence post and even cars. In almost all cases the swarm will take off again within a day or two to occupy a most suitable permanent home elsewhere.</p> <h2>How to get rid of bees</h2> <p>Contrary to popular belief bees aren't protected and can be treated, however, they are endangered so we'd always recommend exploring all other avenues before considering eradication. Below is a step by step guide to assist you:</p> <h3>Leave them alone</h3> <p>Bees don't cause any problems to your property, and nor are you in danger of being stung if they are left alone and unprovoked. After the summer season, most bees will go away and not return to the nesting site the following year. By the time a colony has become obvious its activity will be about to decline naturally. Generally, colonies formed in spring usually decline naturally by late July, if not sooner. Therefore If at all possible always leave bee nests alone to thrive as their presence is actually beneficial for gardeners and their crop.</p> <h3>Relocation</h3> <p>If a nest is outside or underground then there shouldn't be a reason to really move it. In more conventional and accessible places such as bushes, trees and sheds, then contacting a local beekeeper or pest controller to relocate the nest is an option. If you suspect you have honeybees and they are causing you problems then we would recommend you use a swarm collector from the <a href=\"http://www.bbka.org.uk/swarm\" target=\"_blank\">British Bee Keepers Association</a>&nbsp;or getting in touch with the <a href=\"https://www.treebee.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Tree Bee Society</a>. In most cases, they will come and collect the swarm free of charge. Some pest management companies have the skills to remove nests from tricky places such as chimneys and cavities. You can find them through our <a href=\"/find-a-pest-controller\">Find a Pest Controller</a>&nbsp;tool.&nbsp;</p> <p>Only if the location of a nest is dangerous and removal not possible, should the next step be an option.</p> <h3>Eradication</h3> <p>The decision to treat will depend if it is possible to close the entrance(s) to the nest after treatment. In this circumstance make sure you use a trained professional. We strongly recommend you contact a professional pest control company, preferably a member of the BPCA. A trained professional will have the technical knowledge and access to a range of professional use insecticides which are not available to the public.</p> <p>Post-treatment requirements will vary depending on the species of bees you have. For bumblebees and tree bees, blocking up access points will prevent non-target bees from entering and getting contaminated, as well as shortening the likelihood of other bees accessing the same area in the future.</p> <p>For solitary/masonry bees, in the long-term, re-pointing with sound mortar is the only answer. However, this must be thorough as bees hunting for a nest site will soon locate areas that have been missed.</p> <p>For honey bees, it is essential that entrance points or blocked off, and if possible remove all the honeycomb. Failure to do this will cause robber bees to find the infected honey and take it back to their hive, thus contaminating it.</p> <p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: Due to ethical reasons, not all pest control companies will treat for bees so you may have to contact multiple companies.</strong></p> <h3>Having problems with bees?</h3> <p>Contact the <a href=\"https://www.treebee.org.uk/\">Tree Bee Society</a>&nbsp;or use a trained professional pest controller.</p> <p><a href=\"/find-a-pest-controller\" class=\"button button_action\">Search for your local BPCA member</a></p>",

When dry, pigeon droppings can become airborne in small particles, which can lead to respiratory complaints such as psittacosis.</p> <p>Bird droppings are acidic and can corrode/erode metals, stonework and brickwork. Nesting materials birds use can block chimneys, flues and guttering, causing possible issues with carbon monoxide and damage to buildings as water overflows from blocked gutters.</p> <p>Buildings covered in fouling looks unpleasant can smell, and projects a poor image of a business, potentially ruining an organisation's reputation.

So if you have a current or past problem with birds and have done nothing, you may find you'll suffer from a parasite infestation too.</p> <p>The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 protects all wild birds, their nests and eggs. However, specific exemptions permit certain species to be controlled by particular methods for specific reasons. This exemption is given in the way of a licence issued by Natural England (other authorities apply to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) called the General licence. General licences are issued to allow certain actions to be carried out that would otherwise be illegal under the legislation, without the need for people to apply for a specific licence.</p> <p>However, the law only allows competent people such as professional pest controllers to deal with certain species that are widely accepted to be pests. You should always consult with a professional before you consider any form of bird control measures, as the list of birds that are considered pests can change on a regular basis, and even pest species must be dealt with humanely, or you may be prosecuted.</p> <p><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"Birds-3\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/A-Z/Birds/Birds-3.jpg\" alt=\"Birds-3\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></p> <p>All urban birds require to thrive is a nesting/ roosting sites (e.g. balconies, window ledges and roof areas of surrounding buildings) and reliable food sources. The number of birds attracted to an area will depend on what food is available.

Control of birds through population reduction techniques is generally both less desirable and less effective than removing their food sources or blocking off sites where they perch or roost. The latter technique, known as proofing, is now used extensively.</p> <p><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"birds-4\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/A-Z/Birds/birds-4.jpg\" alt=\"birds-4\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></p> <p>For proofing, professional pest controllers will use methods such as barriers, spikes, nets and wire to great effect. More recently active systems like shock strips, audible scarers and optical gels have been used to create negative associations in birds wishing to land or roost on buildings. All of these methods of proofing have their merits and some can offer a stronger and more lasting deterrent, but as with any method of control, they may become less effective over an extended period of time. For a heavy bird infestation, your professional contractor may have to employ methods of control such as shooting, trapping or flying of predatory birds.</p> <h3>Having problems with birds?</h3> <p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">For any bird work, we would strongly recommend contacting a professional pest control company, preferably a member of the BPCA.

They acquire these pathogens whilst crawling or feeding on infected materials such as waste, and may then subsequently infect human food when they alight on it. This transfer may occur simply as the fly walks on the food, but will also take place as a result of the fly's defecation and regurgitation.</p> <p>The simple presence of numbers of flying insects may be an irritating nuisance to staff, customers. Clearly, the threshold at which many guests, customers, or the public become upset by insects is relatively low, and unhappy customers lead to complaints.</p> <p><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"Blowfly-1\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/A-Z/Blow Fly/Blowfly-1.jpg\" alt=\"Blowfly-1\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" />In any food production or sales environment, the local Environmental Health Department has a responsibility to enforce food safety and environmental health legislation. Typically EHOs will work with and advise businesses where potential insect issues are present. However as a last resort, and where advice has not been heeded, then legal action may be taken against offenders, potentially leading to more negative exposure for the business. This negative publicity can have a significant impact on the public's and customers' perception of the brand. This, in turn, is likely to affect the business itself.</p> <h2>How to get rid of Blow Flies</h2> <p>Find out more on our <a href=\"/pest-advice/a-z-of-pests/134356\">Flies advice page</a>.</p> <h3>Having problems with Blow Flies?</h3> <p>Use a trained professional pest controller.</p> <p><a href=\"/find-a-pest-controller\" class=\"button button_action\">Search for your local BPCA member</a></p>",

Try and keep susceptible rooms such as the kitchen and bathroom well ventilated and dry by opening windows as often possible.</p> <p>Always keep your dry foodstuffs such as cereals in a cool dry well-ventilated place. Cleaning out your cupboards regularly, ensuring they are completely dry before putting your food back will help.</p> <p>If you are cooking, boiling the kettle or even just using the washing machine for extended periods of time, then make sure that the kitchen is properly ventilated.</p> <h3>How to get rid of Booklice</h3> <p>They do not bite and can be easily eradicated. To resolve the issue we would recommend removing any infested food, wipe away any visible mould, thoroughly ventilate and dry the area where they are found.</p> <p>Good ventilation is key to success. Opening windows and doors as much as possible to ventilate and dry out the damp is essential. Use of a dehumidifier might help this process. Alternatively, heat the room where they occur to a high temperature as they survive poorly in dry heat</p> <p>For a heavy Booklice infestation, we would recommend you contact professional pest control company, preferably a member of the BPCA to administer an insecticidal spray treatment to minimise the problem. A trained professional will have the technical knowledge and access to a range of professional use products and equipment which are not available to the public.</p> <h3>Having problems with Booklice?</h3> <p>Use a trained professional pest controller.</p> <p><a href=\"/find-a-pest-controller\" class=\"button button_action\">Search for your local BPCA member</a></p>",

The Oriental Cockroach deposits its 13mm long egg capsule on packaging, sacking or in suitable dark crevices before the 16 to 18 nymphs hatch around 12 weeks later. They grow in stages, from nymphs to maturity in 6 to 12 months for the Oriental Cockroach, and 6 to 12 weeks for the German Cockroach.</p> <h3>Habitat</h3> <p>Cockroaches are rarely able to survive out of doors in the British climate but thrive around the heating ducts and boiler rooms of large centrally heated buildings e.g. hospitals, bakeries, hotels and restaurant kitchens, and blocks of flats. They cluster around pipes, stoves, and sinks, especially in humid areas, and will often remain hidden during the day.</p> <h3>Diet</h3> <p>Cockroaches will feed on almost anything, including refuse, faecal matter and food for consumption. They also require access to water and will be generally found in inaccessible harbourages, close to water and food. Cockroaches can survive for several months without food, but will not live for more than a few days without water.</p> <h2><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"Why-you-need-domestic-pest-control\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/Domestic Advice/Why-you-need-domestic-pest-control.png\" alt=\"Why-you-need-domestic-pest-control\" width=\"300\" />Why control Cockroaches?</h2> <p>When foraging for food and water, Cockroaches can contaminate food, utensils, and preparation surfaces as they go. They taint food with an obnoxious smell and can be vectors of disease, capable of carrying the organisms which cause food poisoning in humans and many other bacteria.</p> <p>Cockroaches can ruin an organisation's reputation. If clients and customers spot evidence of cockroach infestation in the premises you manage, they are likely to complain and request a refund, report on your company negatively potentially resulting in closure by an Environmental Health officer, making it unlikely for some people to want to do business with you again.</p> <h3>How to prevent Cockroaches</h3> <p>Areas with food, water and dark spaces to hide are ideal environments for Cockroaches to live. Here few prevention tips for securing your property:</p> <ul> <li>Keep areas clean and tidy - Clean all surfaces thoroughly to remove any food residue. Try and not leave dirty dishes and utensils in the sink. Keep bins covered, clean, and emptied regularly. Areas such as top or beneath your refrigerator are warm and food collect their, attracting Cockroaches, so clean these areas regularly</li> <li>Proofing and Repair - seal gaps around doors, windows, and where utility lines enter to prevent entry. If possible, repair any leaks beneath the sink, and on the sink top, immediately, thus cutting a potential water source</li> </ul> <h3>How to get rid of Cockroaches</h3> <p><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"cockroach-2\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/A-Z/Cockroach/cockroach-2.jpg\" alt=\"cockroach-2\" width=\"300\" />Control of cockroaches is seldom easy because of the difficulty of getting the insecticide to the insect. The insecticide, ideally, should have sufficient persistence to kill the nymphs hatching later from un-hatched egg capsules.</p> <p>For any Cockroach infestation, we would always recommend contacting a professional pest control company, preferably a member of the BPCA. They are trained in cockroach control and will have access to a range of professional use insecticides which are not available to the public.</p> <p>However, if you decide to carry out the work yourself then you can buy amateur use insecticides from a local hardware store. Before you do anything please consider the following steps:</p> <ul> <li>Hygiene - A thorough clean of the area should take place prior to the insecticidal treatment. Pay particular attention to removing food and water sources and hiding places.</li> <li>Sticky traps - The use of sticky traps is not recommended for controlling cockroaches, but should be used for monitoring purposes only.</li> <li>Insecticidal control - The success of the treatment depends on what insecticides are chosen, and how thorough the application is. Remember to pay particular attention to cracks and crevices where eggs and nymphs may be found.</li> <li>When using any insecticide, make sure it is administered in a safe and secure manner, and that products are kept out of reach of children and pets.</li> </ul> <p><strong>WARNING: When using insecticides always follow the instructions on the label.</strong></p> <h3>Having problems with Cockroaches?</h3> <p>Use a trained professional pest controller.</p> <p><a href=\"/find-a-pest-controller\" class=\"button button_action\">Search for your local BPCA member</a></p>",

The females lay their eggs after feeding on the infested animal. Female Fleas can live up to two years, during which time they can lay up to 1000 eggs. The eggs drop onto the floor and the animal's bedding - they can't lay viable eggs in the absence of the host animal blood meal. After several days the eggs will develop into larvae. When fully grown the larvae spin well camouflaged silken cocoons. When fully developed the adult waits within this until it detects the vibrations caused by a potential host. Only then does it emerge. The complete life cycle takes about a month in the summer.</p> <h3>Habitat</h3> <p>Mainly active in communal rooms where pets sleep and where there is most activity. Fleas are found to be living on domestic animals, in carpets, pet bedding and upholstered furniture.</p> <h3>Diet</h3> <p>Adult Fleas feed on the blood of humans and animals. The larval stages live in the nest of the host and feed on skin, feathers and, most importantly, the blood-rich faeces of the adult flea.</p> <h3><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"Flea-2\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/A-Z/Flea/Flea-2.jpg\" alt=\"Flea-2\" width=\"300\" />Why control Fleas?</h3> <p>In the UK there is little evidence that Fleas spread disease.

Different people react differently to a bite, both regarding the degree of reaction and time taken to react.</p> <h3>Signs of a Flea infestation</h3> <p>Pets constantly scratching may be the first sign, which can be confirmed either by seeing fleas or flea droppings in the coat of your pet. These signs are easily spotted in light coloured animals by brushing back the hair. In dark coated breeds it may be better to comb the animal over a sheet of paper to highlight any flea droppings as they fall. The identity of the black specks may be confirmed by adding a few drops of water if they turn red, your pet has fleas.</p> <p>You might spot bites on you or family members, usually around ankles and legs. In humans, flea bites can produce an irritating and allergic reaction. The typical symptom of a flea bite is a small red spot about 5mm in diameter.</p> <p>If you have an active infestation, you may see Fleas jumping in your carpet and furniture.</p> <h3>How do I prevent a Fleas?</h3> <p>It's difficult to prevent your pets from getting Fleas. However, there are some things you can do to reduce your chances of getting them:</p> <ol> <li>Pet maintenance - Applying veterinary approved Flea products to your pet on a regular basis.</li> <li>Vacuuming - Frequently vacuum the areas your pet is around, especially carpeted areas in and any furniture that is frequented by your pet.</li> <li>Washing - Regularly wash your pet's bedding, blanket and other washable items in the hottest water possible.</li> <li>Gardening - Try and keep your garden neat and tidy by mowing your lawn and raking up any leaves, grass or bush clippings.</li> </ol> <h3>How to get rid of Fleas</h3> <p>For a Flea infestation, we strongly recommend you contact a professional pest control company, preferably a member of the BPCA. A trained professional will have the technical knowledge and access to a range of professional use insecticides which are not available to the public.</p> <p>Before an insecticide treatment, clear as much floor space as possible to ensure that treatment is as thorough as possible. Vacuuming all areas helps to remove any debris, eggs, larvae and adult fleas. The vibration of the vacuum cleaner also stimulates adults to hatch from their cocoon stage. Remember to remove the waste collection compartment/bag, from the vacuum cleaner, and dispose of it in an outside bin as you may have collected eggs, larvae and adult fleas while vacuuming.</p> <p>The standard treatment for infested premises is the application of a residual insecticide, either as a liquid spray or powder. The insecticide is applied to all floor surfaces. Ensure you do not vacuum or wash for at least two weeks (or longer if possible), or you'll be in danger of eliminating the residual insecticide which will lead to a failed treatment.</p> <h3>Having problems with fleas?</h3> <p>Use a trained professional pest controller.</p> <p><a href=\"/find-a-pest-controller\" class=\"button button_action\">Search for your local BPCA member</a></p>",

Their favourite foods are cereal products, although they will eat almost anything.</p> <h3><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"Why-you-need-domestic-pest-control\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/Domestic Advice/Why-you-need-domestic-pest-control.png\" alt=\"Why-you-need-domestic-pest-control\" width=\"325\" />Why control House Mice?</h3> <p>House Mice have been known to spread some nasty diseases to humans such as Salmonella, Listeria, which can cause food poisoning.</p> <p>These nibbling nuisances have a compulsive need to gnaw to keep their incisor teeth worn down to a constant length. Electric cables, water and gas pipes, packaging and woodwork, may all be seriously damaged by mice - many instances of electrical fires and floods have been attributed to them.</p> <p>House Mice can ruin an organisation's reputation. If clients and customers spot evidence of rodent infestation in the premises you manage, they are unlikely to want to do business with you.</p> <h3>Signs of a mouse activity</h3> <ul> <li>House Mice droppings - Droppings are often black, rod-shaped and 3-6mm long. Fresh droppings will be soft and moist. Each mouse can leave approximately 80 droppings per day. Common places to find mouse droppings are under the kitchen sink, around central heating boilers and in roof spaces</li> <li>Smear marks - These are dark grey marks left on surfaces by repeated contact with the oils in mouse fur.</li> <li>Nests - Sometimes nests can be found indoors for example in lofts, under floorboards or in airing cupboards</li> <li>Gnawing - House Mice gnaw continually on materials such as wood, carpets, paper, pipe cables and furniture. Check for damage to foodstuffs in cupboards</li> </ul> <h3>How to prevent House Mice</h3> <p>Eliminate any harbourage points such as sealing gaps around pipes and under sheds; Mice only need a gap of 5mm to gain entry, but normally they are 20-30mm in diameter.<br />Remove potential nesting sites by keeping yards and gardens clean and tidy, by cutting back overgrown areas and clearing any piles of wood/debris.</p> <p>Cover any household waste where House Mice can get access to it, close dustbin lids and cover compost heaps.</p> <h3><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"House Mouse-2\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/A-Z/House Mouse/House_Mouse-2.jpg\" alt=\"House Mouse-2\" width=\"325\" />How to get rid of House Mice</h3> <p>It is important to get rid of mice quickly, as House Mice are adaptable, highly mobile and breed rapidly - this combination can make mouse control a difficult task for the untrained individual. For any mouse infestation, we would always recommend contacting a professional pest control company, preferably a member of the BPCA. They are trained in mouse control and will have access to a range of professional use rodenticides which are not available to the public.</p> <p>If you decide to carry out the work yourself, then you can buy amateur use poisons and traps from a hardware store or garden centre. However, due to their habits, traditional baiting techniques and trapping frequently do not work, and a combination of rodenticides may be necessary.</p> <p>An alternative to using poisons are break-back traps. You may catch mice if baited with nutty chocolate, raisins or similar attractive food and placed close to signs of mouse activity. Ironically, cheese is a comparatively poor mouse-baiter. Place traps close to, and at right angles to, walls so the treadle may be activated from either direction.</p> <p>When placing poison or traps, make sure they are in a safe and secure location out of reach of children and pets. Also, proofing all means of entry as much possible will help to prevent entry. Blocking holes with wire wool embedded in quick-setting cement, and fit metal strips to doors to prevent mice from entering.</p> <p class=\"highlight--green-light\"><strong>WARNING: When using rodenticides always follow the instructions on the label, and importantly search for and dispose of any dead rodents in a safe manner.</strong></p> <h3>Having problems with Mice?</h3> <p>Use a trained professional pest controller.</p> <p><a href=\"/find-a-pest-controller\" class=\"button button_action\">Search for your local BPCA member</a></p>",

Adult female mosquitoes hibernate in dark corners of houses, sheds, cellars and other sheltered sites.</p> <h3>How to get rid of Mosquitoes</h3> <p>Breeding sites such as guttering, water butts and bird baths should be cleaned out regularly. Fly screens over open windows will prevent adults coming in, or aerosol fly sprays will kill individual mosquitoes.</p> <p>If the problem persists, we would recommend you contact professional pest control company, preferably a member of the BPCA to administer a professional treatment to solve the problem. A trained professional will have the technical knowledge and access to a range of professional use products and equipment which are not available to the public.</p> <h3>Having problems with Mosquitoes?</h3> <p>Use a trained professional pest controller.</p> <p><a href=\"/find-a-pest-controller\" class=\"button button_action\">Search for your local BPCA member</a></p>",

Their accumulated droppings are also sources of disease.</p> <p>Birds such as Pigeons carry a variety of diseases such as Ornithosis, Listeria and E-coli that can be transmitted to man not only from the droppings but also the birds themselves. When dry, pigeon droppings can become airborne in small particles, which can lead to respiratory complaints such as psittacosis.</p> <p>Pigeon droppings are acidic and can corrode/erode metals, stonework and brickwork. Nesting materials birds use can block chimneys, flues and guttering, causing possible issues with carbon monoxide and damage to buildings as water overflows from blocked gutters.</p> <p><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"Why-you-need-domestic-pest-control\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/Domestic Advice/Why-you-need-domestic-pest-control.png\" alt=\"Why-you-need-domestic-pest-control\" width=\"300\" />Buildings covered in fouling looks unpleasant can smell, and projects a poor image of business, potentially ruining an organisation's reputation.

So if you have a current or past problem with birds and have done nothing, you may find you'll suffer from a parasite infestation too.</p> <h3>How to prevent and get rid of birds</h3> <p>Pigeon prevention, proofing and control are a highly specialised skill, requiring specialist equipment and tools. Control of Pigeons through population reduction techniques is generally both less desirable and less effective than removing their food sources or blocking off sites where they perch or roost. The latter technique, known as proofing, is now used extensively.</p> <p><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"Pigeons-2\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/A-Z/Pigeons/Pigeons-2.jpg\" alt=\"Pigeons-2\" width=\"300\" />For proofing, professional pest controllers will use methods such as barriers, spikes, nets and wire to great effect. More recently active systems like shock strips, audible scarers and optical gels have been used to create negative associations in birds wishing to land or roost on buildings. All of these methods of proofing have their merits, and some can offer a stronger and more lasting deterrent, but as with any method of control, they may become less effective over an extended period. For a heavy Pigeon infestation, your professional contractor may have to employ methods of control such as shooting, trapping or flying of predatory birds.</p> <h3>Having problems with Pigeons?</h3> <p>Use a trained professional pest controller.</p> <p><a href=\"/find-a-pest-controller\" class=\"button button_action\">Search for your local BPCA member</a></p>",

It has a blunt muzzle, small hair-covered ears and a tail that is shorter than its body. The <a href=\"/pest-advice/a-z-of-pests/132534\">Black Rat</a>&nbsp;weighs half as much and is shorter. It has a pointed muzzle, large, almost hairless ears, a more slender body and a long thin tail that is longer than its body.</p> <h3>Characteristics</h3> <p>Rats have well-developed senses of smell taste and touch. They have an acute sense of hearing, frequently using ultrasound to communicate, and is especially sensitive to any sudden noise. Both species breed rapidly and become sexually mature in about three months. Each female may produce from 3 to 12 litters of between six and eight young in a year. Rats need to gnaw to keep their constantly growing incisor teeth worn down. They damage woodwork, plastic, bricks and lead pipes, and will strip insulation from electrical cables.</p> <h3>Habitat</h3> <p>Brown Rats live in any situation that provides food, water and shelter. In homes, they will live in roof spaces, wall cavities or under floorboards. In gardens, they will burrow into grassy banks or under sheds. Brown Rats are often found living in sewer systems. Black Rats are rare and are occasionally found in shipping ports.</p> <h3>Diet</h3> <p>Rats feed mostly at night, and an average rat will eat 50g of food a day. Preferred foods are cereal products, although rats are omnivorous and will eat almost anything that humans eat.</p> <h3><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"Why-you-need-domestic-pest-control\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/Domestic Advice/Why-you-need-domestic-pest-control.png\" alt=\"Why-you-need-domestic-pest-control\" width=\"325\" />Why control Rats?</h3> <p>Rats carry many nasty diseases which they can spread to humans, normally through their urine, including; Leptospirosis or Weil's disease, Salmonella, Listeria, Toxoplasma gondii and Hantavirus.</p> <p>Rats can inflict an enormous amount of structural damage. They can cause severe fires by gnawing away the insulation around electrical cables, floods by puncturing pipes and even death by chewing through gas pipes. The insurance sector has estimated that rodent damage to wiring is responsible for 25% of all electrical fires in buildings.</p> <p>Rats can ruin an organisation's reputation. If clients and customers spot evidence of rodent infestation in the premises you manage, they are unlikely to want to do business with you.</p> <p>Property owners have a legal obligation under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949 to keep premises rodent free, or, if rodents pose a threat to health or property, to report infestations to the local authority.</p> <h3><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"Brown Rat 3\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/A-Z/Brown Rat/Brown_Rat_3.jpg\" alt=\"Brown Rat 3\" width=\"325\" />How to prevent Rats</h3> <p>You can put steps in place to try and avoid a rat infestation:</p> <ul> <li>Eliminate any harbourage<span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"> points such as sealing gaps around pipes and under sheds; rats only need a gap of 15mm to gain entry.</span></li> <li>Remove potential nesting sites by keeping yards and gardens clean and tidy, by cutting back overgrown areas and clearing any piles of wood/debris.</li> <li>Ensure that drain inspection covers are in a good state of repair.</li> <li>Cover any household waste where rats can get access to it, close dustbin lids and cover compost heaps.</li> <li>If you feed garden birds, do not do this to excess and use a bird table or feeder basket if possible.</li> </ul> <h3>How to get rid of Rats</h3> <p>Rats are adaptable, highly mobile and breed rapidly; this combination can make rat control a difficult task for the untrained individual. For any rat infestation, we would always recommend contacting a professional pest control company, preferably a member of the BPCA. They are trained in rat control and will have access to a range of professional use rodenticides which are not available to the public.</p> <p><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"black rat 2\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/A-Z/Black Rat/black_rat_2.jpg\" alt=\"black rat 2\" width=\"325\" />However, if you decide to carry out the work yourself, then you can buy amateur use poisons and traps from a hardware store or garden centre. Most rats are wary of new objects such as traps or poisons placed in their environment and will avoid them for a period before exploring them, so don't expect instant success. When placing poison or traps, make sure they are in a safe and secure place out of reach of children and pets.</p> <p><strong class=\"highlight--green-light\">WARNING: When using rodenticides always follow the instructions on the label, and importantly search for and dispose of any dead rodents in a safe manner.</strong></p> <h3>Having problems with Rats?</h3> <p>Use a trained professional pest controller.</p> <p><a href=\"/find-a-pest-controller\" class=\"button button_action\">Search for your local BPCA member</a></p>",

They have a sweet tooth at one end and a painful sting at the other.</p> <h3>Characteristics</h3> <p>The queen wasp is larger than normal wasps (about 20mm), and she hibernates over winter, making a nest in the spring in which to lay her eggs. She feeds the grubs on insects until they develop into worker wasps, three to four weeks later. Workers, all sterile females, forage for over a mile in search of food. At the end of the year when the colder air arrives, and any fruit that has been edible starts to perish quickly, wasps start to starve as food becomes increasingly hard to find. The adult worker wasps start to die off, and the new queen wasps go into hibernation and emerge in the spring to initiate the process again, building completely brand new nests. One nest may produce 30,000 wasps in a year.</p> <h3>Diet</h3> <p>Natural pest controllers wasps tend to eat other insects. However at their peak in August and September with the youngsters reared, the workers turn to the sweet food they prefer and become a nuisance wherever this is available.</p> <h3><img class=\"img_right caption__image\" title=\"Wasp-3\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/A-Z/Wasp/Wasp-3.jpg\" alt=\"Do you have something like this in your loft? It's a wasp nest!\" width=\"325\" />Habitat</h3> <p>Common Wasps, generally build their nests inside something, this can be a roof space/loft, garden shed, inside an air brick or even in the ground. Other Wasps build their nests in bushes, trees, hedgerows and even underground. They build their nests anywhere that they find suitable and where it is protected from the elements and is undisturbed. They build their nest itself using chewed wood and saliva to make a papier mache material. The nest material is durable, lightweight and surprisingly waterproof.</p> <h3>Why control Wasps?</h3> <p>One of the most feared and aggressive pests, wasps will attack and sting, sometimes unprovoked but usually if threatened. This is a risk and a cause for concern, if you have small children or pets as for some wasp stings, can be very dangerous causing severe reactions, with several people dying from wasp stings every year.</p> <p>If customers experience a high level of Wasp activity at your premises, then they are likely to complain and request a refund, report on your company negatively potentially resulting in a loss of future income.</p> <h3><img class=\"img_right\" title=\"Wasp-1\" src=\"/write/MediaUploads/Pages/A-Z/Wasp/Wasp-1.jpg\" alt=\"Wasp-1\" width=\"325\" /></h3> <h3>How to get rid of wasps?</h3> <p>Wasps should only be treated if they pose a risk to public health and safety.&nbsp;</p> <p>Treating a wasp nest can be very dangerous. Wasps inside the nest will feel threatened and often become aggressive. This could cause them to sting you and others as they defend their nest and young.</p> <p>To get rid of wasps you do &lsquo;not' need to remove the nest, but you do need to treat it. For treating a wasp nest make sure you use a trained professional for safety reasons.

The first sign of woodworm is the appearance of neat round holes, 2mm across, in wooden surfaces, often accompanied by tiny piles of wood dust beneath them. Fresh holes show clean white wood inside. Emerging adult beetles make the holes. Immature grubs may still be tunnelling away inside the wood.",
   "PestType": "Timber pest",
   "Description": "<p>The adult Furniture Beetle is a small brown insect 3mm to 6mm long which flies quite readily. It lays eggs on rough, unpolished wood and the grubs bore straight into the wood - leaving no trace until they emerge as beetles three years or so later, usually between May and September.</p> <p>Woodworm is frequently introduced into the house in second-hand furniture, tea chests or wicker-work; but the beetles are quite capable of flying in through a window from nearby dead branches of trees. They may then attack floorboards, joinery and, more seriously, structural timbers such as rafters and joists.</p> <p>Other wood borers include:</p> <ul> <li>Death Watch Beetle, which infests only large old hardwood beams; the House Longhorn, confined - at least for the moment - to North West Surrey</li> <li>Powder Post Beetle which needs a diet of starch in certain hardwoods, and wood boring weevils, which are associated with wet rot and die out when it is treated.</li> </ul> <h3>Remedy</h3> <p>Woodworm in furniture can be cured by application of proprietary woodworm killer. Coat all surfaces, polished and unpolished, and inject fluid into a few flight holes with a special injector. As a precaution against woodworm, you can buy an insecticidal polish.</p> <p>Woodworm in structural timbers can be treated on a do-it-yourself basis, and the proprietary fluids used by the experts are available from builders&rsquo; merchants. All timbers must be cleaned down first, and any roof insulation material will have to be removed temporarily so that you can get at the joists to work on them. Also, this avoids the fire-risk of insulation becoming impregnated with the fluid or small polystyrene granules dissolving together.</p> <p>Cover electric cables and the cold water storage tank. Floorboards must be lifted to get at the undersides and the joists. Follow label recommendations carefully. Specialist wood preservation companies give detailed surveys, reports and estimates from the British Wood Preserving and Damp-proofing Association. Many cover their treatments by long-term guarantees - useful evidence of treatment if you want to sell the house. It is usually wise therefore to leave structural woodworm to the experts.</p> <h3>Having problems with Woodworm?</h3> <p>Use a professional pest controller.</p> <p><a href=\"/find-a-pest-controller\" class=\"button button_action\">Search for your local BPCA member</a></p>",
